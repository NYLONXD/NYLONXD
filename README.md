## 🚀 About Me

```typescript
const himanshu = {
    code: ["C++", "JavaScript", "Python"],
    architecture: ["Full Stack", "Real-time Systems", "Decentralized Apps"],
    currentFocus: "Building scalable solutions that matter",
    challenge: "Turning complex problems into elegant experiences",
    philosophy: "Code is poetry. Make it beautiful, make it work, make it fast.",
    mindset: "Innovation isn't just about technology—it's about impact",
    
    askMeAbout: ["web dev", "backend architecture", "real-time systems", "problem solving"],

```

🔭 Currently exploring **FastAPI**, **Decentralized Systems**, and **Real-time Analytics**  
🎯 Building projects that bridge the gap between **complex backend logic** and **stunning frontend experiences**  
💡 Passionate about **clean code**, **scalable architecture**, and **developer experience**  
🌱 Believer in **continuous learning** and **shipping fast, iterating faster**  
⚡ On a mission to prove that **engineering can be both powerful and elegant**

## 🧠 How I Think

- **Backend-first mindset** — I design from the data layer up, ensuring the foundation is rock-solid before building the UI
- **Clear data flow > clever code** — Readable, maintainable systems beat over-engineered solutions every time
- **Built to scale, designed to fail** — Systems should handle growth gracefully and fail predictably when they do
- **Performance is a feature** — I think about caching strategies, latency bottlenecks, and database optimization from day one
- **Ship with understanding** — I don't deploy code I can't explain. If it works by accident, it's not done
- **Observability matters** — Logs, metrics, and monitoring aren't afterthoughts—they're part of the architecture

## ⚙️ Engineering Principles

```python
principles = {
    "api_design": "Stateless, predictable, versioned",
    "architecture": "Separation of concerns, modularity first",
    "performance": "Cache before you scale, measure before you optimize",
    "reliability": "Fail-fast, handle errors explicitly, no silent failures",
    "deployment": "Observability-driven, monitor what matters",
    "code_quality": "Self-documenting code, meaningful tests, clear commit messages"
}
```

## 🎯 Current Mission

```javascript
while (alive) {
    eat();
    sleep();
    code();
    innovate();
    repeat();
}
```

- 🔍 **Seeking:** Backend-heavy internships where I can work on real distributed systems and performance challenges
- 🚀 **Building:** Products that solve actual problems with clean architecture—not just features, but foundations
- 📚 **Learning:** Advanced system design, distributed computing, database internals, and performance optimization at scale
- 🤝 **Open to:** Collaborating on technically challenging projects that push my engineering skills forward

**Let's build something meaningful together.** If you're working on real-world problems that need thoughtful engineering, I'd love to connect.

## 💡 What I Care About

**I avoid:** Shallow CRUD apps, over-engineered solutions that solve problems that don't exist, projects where speed beats understanding

**I pursue:** Ownership over tasks, performance that users feel, architecture that makes future changes easier, projects with real purpose
